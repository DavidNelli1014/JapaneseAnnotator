# JapaneseAnnotator
An HTML static site that allows you to annotate Japanese text to aid you in learning the languages. Your annotations and translations can be exported to a JSON file, which can be later imported to be referenced and accelerate later annotations. If you have no file to import, import an empty JSON file.

To create an annotation. Write or paste Japanese text into the text box and write the corresponfing English translation in the box to the right. Text can also be highlighted below the text box to create translations for individual words. Suggestions for individual word annotations will appear if the highlighted word is present in any past annotations you have made.
